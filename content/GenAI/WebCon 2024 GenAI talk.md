# What's been good/useful for me:
## Augment or complement my skills

1. Help me with Blender. Help me learn Blender.

```ad-noprint
I'm better at Python than I am at Blender.
```

Ex: Create a dodecahedron in bpy, and tell me how you're doing it. 

| Script | Video of Results | ChatSession |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
|        |                  |             |

- GitHub

Ex: Move an object in x steps to a destination point, and tell me how you're doing it.

## Generate ideas and brainstorm
- Based on 

# What's been disappointing for me:
## Inconsistency of results, even I ask for the same thing, and when I refer to the genID. 
- No "coverage" in the script sense [image of alternate camera angles]
- Not high-res enough to punch in 

### So inconsistent, what is the point of the genID?

### So what's my workaround? Other AI tools:
- TopazAI Photo
	- Upres the stills
	- Remove the extra things in the foreground with Photoshop

## Disobedience, even when supplied with reference images

## Generic-ness of imagery

### Look more like like fashion shoot or Hollywood film than real life
- Expressions of people's faces
- No faces
- **Doesn't know they roundish objects so the clips have to be very short**


## Digital Handout
### 1. **Curated List of Tools and Platforms**

- **Comprehensive Guide**: Provide a list of GenAI tools and platforms relevant to A/V work, including both free and paid options. For each tool, briefly describe its capabilities, limitations, and potential use cases.
