### Talk Title: AI-Generated Art: Understanding the Potential https://webcon.illinois.edu/timetable/event/ai-generated-art/
**Speakers:** [Michael Curtin](https://webcon.illinois.edu/michael-curtin/), [Amy Young](https://webcon.illinois.edu/amy-young/)
**Date:** April 4, 2024, UIUC WebCon
**Abstract**: Join us on an exciting exploration of the rapidly evolving world of **visually generative AI**. This fascinating technology is transforming numerous industries in eye-opening ways. We’ll showcase inspiring use cases in the **film** and *video game spheres*, where AI is reinventing **visual storytelling** and gameplay. You’ll get hands-on with **fun demos that prove these cutting-edge tools can be harnessed by non-artists too.** We’ll also delve into the profound impacts on ***art education**, as AI redefines how creativity is taught and learned*. This is a front-row seat to an AI-powered creative revolution – don’t miss it!

## Questions for Michael:  
 ### Maybe we should each have:
 - something like three resources?
 - a combined Q&A at the end? 
 - each start with a quote or two?
 - and end section "future directions" or something open ended, but similar-sounding?
 - is it reasonable to mention that I pay for my own licenses for all these things?
 - what are some FAQs we can envision? is another session covering them? 
		- for example: status of any kind of campus site-license?

# How I use GenAI / AI for Audio-Visual work

Memory of Walter S. Mallory about a conversation with Thomas Edison: ‘ I have gotten a lot of results! I know several thousand things that won’t work.’


# What's been good/useful for me:
## Augment or complement my skills

1. Help me with Blender. Help me learn Blender.


Ex: Create a dodecahedron in bpy, and tell me how you're doing it. 

| Script | Video of Results | ChatSession |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
|        |                  |             |

- GitHub

Ex: Move an object in x steps to a destination point, and tell me how you're doing it.

## Generate ideas and brainstorm
- Based on archival photos
- Based on existing photos
- Based on text-to-image
- Based on text-to-video

## Simple up-res-ing
- For handheld work, after stabilizing
- For archival images
- For better-than-nothing 

## Generating eye candy that won't be scrutinized, won't appear for a long time, and nobody knows what it looks like anyway
- Radiation of a black hole

# What's been disappointing for me:
## Inconsistency of results, even I ask for the same thing, and when I refer to the genID. (How is this related to what I am looking for?)
- No "coverage" in the script sense [image of alternate camera angles]
- Not high-res enough to punch in 

### So inconsistent, what is the point of the genID?
It knows the text used to describe it. 

### So what's my workaround? Other AI tools:
- TopazAI Photo
	- Upres the stills
	- Remove the extra things in the foreground with Photoshop

## Disobedience, even when supplied with reference images (How is this related to what I am looking for?)

## Generic-ness of imagery (How is this related to what I am looking for?)

### Look more like like fashion shoot or Hollywood film than real life
- Expressions of people's faces, rather lack of expressions in faces
- - **Doesn't know they roundish objects so the clips have to be very short**
- No faces at all


## Not exactly what I want yet, which I assume is what a lot of people want. 


## Digital Handout
### 1. **Curated List of Tools and Platforms**

- **Comprehensive Guide**: Provide a list of GenAI tools and platforms relevant to A/V work, including both free and paid options. For each tool, briefly describe its capabilities, limitations, and potential use cases.
- **Cost Overview**: Include information on costs or subscription models, if applicable. Highlight any free tiers or trial periods that allow for experimentation without upfront investment.

### 2. **Recommended Reading and Resources**

- **Foundational Literature**: Suggest key articles, papers, and books that lay a solid foundation for understanding GenAI and its application in A/V. Highlight both introductory and advanced materials.
- **Tutorials and Guides**: Share links to tutorials, online courses, or video guides that offer hands-on instruction on using specific GenAI tools or techniques in the A/V field.

### 3. **Examples and Case Studies**
