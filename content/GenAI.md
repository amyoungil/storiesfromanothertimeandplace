### Sorted by Types of Generators


**Text-to-Image Generators**:
    - **Function**: Convert descriptive text into images.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for creating images of scenes or events that don't have existing photographs. You could describe a scene (e.g., "The Wright brothers preparing their plane at dawn") and the AI generates an image based on that description.
    - **Examples**:

## 1.  GenAI Terms: 
**inpainting** - replacing part of an image with another one.
**deep learning** -- makes connections between images, tree bark vs tree bark


## 2.  GenAI Publications - Statements
Substack: https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/the-first-moral-graph #example  #apsjob [[APS Job Canvas.canvas|APS Job Canvas]]
- **We show bridging effects of our new democratic process.** 500 participants were sampled to represent the US population. We focused on divisive topics, like how and if an LLM chatbot should respond in situations like when a user requests abortion advice. We found that Republicans and Democrats come to agreement on values it should use to respond, despite having different views about abortion itself.
    
- **We present the first moral graph, generated by this sample of Americans,** capturing agreement on LLM values despite diverse backgrounds.
    
- **We present good news about their experience:** 71% of participants said the process clarified their thinking, and 75% gained substantial respect for those across the political divide.
    
- **Finally, we’ll say why moral graphs are better targets for alignment than constitutions or simple rules like HHH**. We’ll suggest advantages of moral graphs in safety, scalability, oversight, interpretability, moral depth, and robustness to conflict and manipulation.

2. **Image-to-Image Generators**:
        - **Function**: Transform or manipulate existing images into new forms.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for modifying existing photos of the Wright brothers to depict adjacent events. For instance, taking a photo of the plane and altering it to show it being transported.
    - **Examples**: 
	    - Photoshop's Neural Filters - Pix2PixPhotoshop's Neural Filters, GAN-based tools like Pix2Pix. 

3. **Deepfakes and Face Generators**:
    - **Function**: Generate or alter human faces in images or videos.
    - **Use Case**: Can be used to create images of the Wright brothers or other individuals in scenarios where no photos exist.
    - **Examples**: DeepFaceLab, ZAO. - DeepFaceLab
- [ZAO](https://zaodownload.com/)
    

4. **3D Generative Models**:  
    - **Function**: Create 3D models from textual descriptions or 2D images.

- Google's Dream Fusion 

5. **Style Transfer Generators**:  
    - **Function**: Apply the style of one image (like a painting or a historical photograph) to another image or scene.
    - **Use Case**: To ensure consistency in style with historical photographs when creating new images.
    - **Examples**:- [DeepArt](https://deepart.io/)
- [Prisma](https://prisma-ai.com/)

6. **AI Video Generators**:  
    - **Function**: Create short video clips based on textual descriptions or modify existing video footage.
    - **Use Case**: Generate video clips of events surrounding the iconic flight.
    - **Examples**: - [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/)
- [Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/)
7. **Generative Audio Tools**:
    - **Function**: Create or modify audio tracks, including music and voice. Sound fx.
    - **Use Case**: To generate period-appropriate background music or narration for your video.
    - **Examples**: Descript's Overdub, Google's Magenta. - - Descript's Overdub
	   For generating sound effects like distant trains or ambient woods sounds, you would typically look into Generative Audio tools that specialize in creating or manipulating soundscapes and effects. Here are a few options that might be suitable for your needs:
	
	1. **Sonic Pi**: [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) is a code-based music creation and performance tool, which allows you to programmatically create and manipulate sounds. It's very flexible and can be used to generate a wide range of audio effects, including ambient sounds.
	     **Juk
	2. **LANDR**: LANDR offers AI-driven tools for music creation and sound design. While it's more focused on music production, it can also be used to create and enhance sound effects.
	    
	3. **Jukedeck**: [Jukedeck](https://www.jukedeck.com/) is an AI-powered tool that creates music tracks. Though it's primarily for music, you might be able to use it for background ambiance.
	    
	4. **Boomy**: [Boomy](https://boomy.com/) is another AI music creation tool that lets you create your own songs quickly. While it's music-centric, creative use of its features could help in generating ambient soundscapes.
	    
	5. **Soundation**: [Soundation](https://soundation.com/) is an online music studio with recording, effects, virtual instruments, and over 700 free loops and sounds. It's a versatile tool for creating a variety of audio effects.
	    
	6. **Zynaptiq Adaptiverb**: Zynaptiq Adaptiverb is a reverb plugin that could be used to create atmospheric sounds, giving a sense of space that could be useful for background ambiance.
	    
	7. **Ambient-Mixer**: [Ambient-Mixer](https://www.ambient-mixer.com/) is a community-drivedeck**:en project where users can create and share ambient sounds. It's a great resource for finding pre-made ambient soundscapes, including trains, forests, and more.
	    
	8.  **Google's Magenta**: Google's Magenta project, which also includes tools for audio, can be used to create and manipulate sound effects.
    
These tools vary in their approach, from AI-driven music and sound generation to community-driven sound libraries. Depending on your specific needs (like creating from scratch versus finding pre-made sounds), some of these options might be more suitable than others.
