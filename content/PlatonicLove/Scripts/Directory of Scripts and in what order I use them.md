This is a list of tasks and the .py scripts which do that task. I think I will start labeling and categorizing my scripts.



|            | Script Number | Goal or Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Scripts                      |

|            | m001          | 1. This script moves Cube.001 to DestinationPoint in 50 frames. [m001_CubeToDestinationPoint.py]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                              |
| 2024-03-05 |               | Here's the corrected path of the cube. I don't quite understand the logic changes (when to calculate the path increments) so I'll have to re-read the explanation. But it works as intended now. Next is to move the little light, again, to the corner, and then figure out how to highlight the nearest edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://youtu.be/-hzv5WEtkWg |
| 2024-02-29 |               | Today the goal is to find, then move the PointLight to, the nearest corner of the cube to DestinationPoint (which is where the cone and sphere fall from, btw). It works well, but somehow the cube isn't aimed at the DestinationPoint anymore. Perhaps I scooted it over, or changed the anchor point, etc. Next: correct the cube's path. And have the cube rotate with the nearest vertex as the point of rotation. Not sure how to do that.                                                                                                                                 | https://youtu.be/wMphkstEoq0 |
| 2024-02-27 |               | For one of the cubes: after a rotation frame (every 5 frames, etc.) light-up a randomly chosen vertex. I think that involves checking the mathematics of which vertex is closest, in a 1-6 loop each time. Then the next step: light-up the vertex closest to the Destination Point. Then after that, light-up the edge closest to the Destination Point. Not sure how to check that, or mathematically how that is described. Somebody will know. And then I will be ready to implement some movement choices based on nearest vertex and nearest edge.                         | https://youtu.be/B3_ld9pty-E |
| 2024-02-25 |               | Goal: Rotate the cube as it moves. Pinned a little point light on to random cube vertices to see if they're really being selected. Next: after a rotation frame (every 5 frames, etc.) then light-up the vertex closest to the Destination Point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://youtu.be/3qva8zwkFmQ |
| 2024-02-24 |               | Goal: Programmatically change the rotation of an object, and set keyframes for that. I made the torus look wobbly. I also softened the lighting. Next: rotate a cube as it moves. And then highlight (whatever that means in Blender) the nearest vertex to the Destination Point. "Swim to the light!")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://youtu.be/rT4NJn_7yU0 |
| 2024-02-23 |               | Took two days to figure how to make Something A swim to Something B, over n frames. Works, but scarily I don't know why this works and the other attempts didn't. Annoying. <br><br>Next:  [x] Save Blender file as is, to have a working version. Label it "~~Working FlyCone~~"  "date" and "snapshot." Clean up the Blender file to remove unwanted/unused objects. Then alter the script so that 1) the desired Cube swims to the Light. 2) Then every 10 frames the Cube rotates n degrees, before moving. Then 3) after rotating, the cube's six vertices are highlighted. | https://youtu.be/ye2yZFS0ug0 |
